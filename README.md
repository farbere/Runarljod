Project aims:
    1. Static Image Recognition: Given an image of an ASL hand gesture, return the letter corresponding to it
    2. Finger Spelling Recognition in Real-Time: given a video of a ASL fingerspelling of a word, decode it.

## Directory Structure
    * ISIM: Initial Still Image Models, playground for simple models of static images
    * PreProcessing: notebooks for pre-processing of the data
    * Playground: testing folder, for testing out ideas
    * Production: modules used for the final training/validation of the model
    * i3d: I3D Model from arXiv:1705.07750
    * notes: some tutorials on packages/models used
    * results: saved pickle files of the trained model(s)
